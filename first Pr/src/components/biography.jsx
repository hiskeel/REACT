            Van Gogh is known for his expressive use of color and dramatic, impulsive brushwork. Some of his most famous works include <em>Starry Night</em>, <em>Sunflowers</em>, and <em>The Bedroom</em>. Although he sold only a few paintings during his lifetime, his work became highly celebrated after his death, and he is now regarded as one of the most influential figures in Western art history.
